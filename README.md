# Welcome to Project-PokÃ©dex

### Task

Clone this repo and build an app that can use the [Pokemon API](https://pokeapi.co/) to display Pokemon in alphabetical order.
You will need to be creative when deciding how to layout the data.
Your app should be able to filter on the criteria of your choosing.
The user should be able to click on a pokemon for more information.

## Libraries allowed

* React (obviously ðŸ˜ƒ)
* React-Router - not required but a huge plus
* [Styled components](https://www.styled-components.com/) is preferred but SASS, SCSS or LESS is also allowed

\*\* Don't use any toolkit libraries (like Lodash, Underscore, or Ramda).

## Submitting your code

* Please submit a pull-request to this repository when your code is ready.
