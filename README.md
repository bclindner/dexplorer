# Dexplorer

This is a simple Pokédex Web app that gives quick overviews for stats, moves,
and other important practical information. This project was originally completed
as a technical test for a job application, but I have decided to adjust and
improve it for fun.


## Technical Details

The app is a single-page [React](https://reactjs.org) app which uses the
[PokéAPI](https://pokeapi.co/) as a backend to look up Pokémon. Navigation and
routing make use of
[react-router](https://github.com/ReactTraining/react-router), and
[styled-components](https://github.com/styled-components/styled-components) for
all custom styles.
